        <h2>History</h2><p>Like a lot of people, I started playing <strong>The
        Fantasy Trip</strong> back around 1979, first with
        <strong>Melee</strong> and <strong>Wizard</strong> and later with the
        full blown <strong>In The Labyrinth</strong>. I was also playing a fair
        bit of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Chivalry &amp; Sorcery, but I found
        Fantasy Trip intriguing in its simple complexity.</p><p>It didn't have
        D&amp;D's "Vancian Magic" (remember a spell, cast it, forget it), which
        I've disliked from day one, and it didn't have classes or levels. A
        character could be and do whatever you wanted without having to fit into
        predesignated slots.  C&amp;S was a similar in those respects, but was
        also an order of magnitude crunchier than D&amp;D - and was printed
        using text so small I can't even read the 1st edition book these
        days.</p><p>Fantasy Trip filled that gap where a game was simple enough
        to be easy to learn and play but complex enough to create a richness of
        detail in the settings &amp; adventures.</p><p>Although I hadn't played
        the game in over 30 years, I was pleasantly surprised when Steve Jackson
        Games resurrected it in 2019 with the <strong>Legacy Edition</strong>. I
        signed up for the full print/PDF package straight away, and was not
        disappointed with the end product. It brought back a lot of
        memories.</p><p>But, time and circumstances came along and I still
        didn't play the game. Then, finally in 2024, I retired and started
        picking up older games, including Fantasy Trip. I couldn't find a local
        gaming group for it, and although there was online support in
        <strong>Roll 20</strong> and <strong>Owlbear Rodeo</strong> could be
        used generically, there wasn't a <strong>Foundry VTT</strong>
        implementation, and Foundry is my go-to VTT these days.</p><p>Luckily,
        I've spent the last 30 years as a software developer, and have even
        implemented a few modules &amp; systems for friends. So, I set about
        implementing it for Foundry, and here's the
        result.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><h2>Design Notes</h2><p>The design philosophy
        for all of the systems I've written for Foundry is not necessarily to
        implement each game rule or process in detail, but rather to implement
        key features in a way that takes the repetitive or complex tasks off of
        the players &amp; GM and makes it easier for them to do the rest. I've
        found this gives the users a lot of freedom in how the rules are
        interpreted and applied without constraining them too much.</p><p>For
        example, I did consider having strict AP limits and XP spending for
        advancement, but determined that would have been complicated to
        implement &amp; use, so opted for a simple AP total on the character
        sheet that highlights in red if a set limit is exceeded without spending
        XP. This gives players an indication of their AP total that they can use
        to determine the cost as per pp45 of the rulebook. It's up to the GM to
        enforce those costs or not, according to how they want the game played.
        XP spends for other items just use the XP total field, manually
        adjusted.</p><p>The same goes for the Dice Roller application. It allows
        players to quickly see what a dice roll is made up from (target
        attribute(s), modifiers, number of dice, etc) and adjust the parameters
        before making the roll. Buttons are provided on the character sheet that
        act as "presets" for attribute rolls, talent rolls, attacks &amp;
        damage, spell casting, etc.</p><p>Encumbrance calculation though, is a
        chore, so I've automated that. A player can have as many items in their
        inventory as they like, they can choose each item's location (dropped,
        equipped, carried, stowed, stored) and the character's total encumbrance
        (based on carried or equipped items) is calculated automatically. That
        encumbrance level is shown on the character sheet and attribute
        penalties are applied automatically. I even added a "container" feature
        so that a character can put items in a backpack which counts them
        against encumbrance when carried, but if the backpack is dropped (say,
        for combat) then all the items in it are also dropped and the combat
        penalties come off immediately.</p><p>Hopefully, this design philosophy
        achieves what I set out to do: make it easy for old and new players to
        play the game the way they want in the way they're used to.</p><p>I'm
        always open to suggestions (and, of course, hearing about bugs), so
        please feel free to use  Github Issues to let me know what you like or
        dislike, what I got wrong, and what you want. Bear in mind though, I'm
        in this for fun, not money, and sometimes life happens and I can't make
        changes quickly.</p><h2>Steve Jackson Online Policy</h2><p>I have tried
        to ensure that this implementation conforms to the <a
        href="https://www.sjgames.com/general/online_policy.html">Steve Jackson
        Online Policy</a>, and since SJG rarely recognize or allow "official"
        versions of their games, this is an unofficial version.  This means that
        while I can implement the mechanisms of the game and even use some of
        the terminology, I cannot cut &amp; paste any significant content from
        the game and distribute it. This is why I've included only a few
        <em>Example Items</em> to show how Talents, Spells, and equipment can be
        built, and none of those items include descriptive text from the
        game.</p><p>If there is content in here that infringes on SJG
        intellectual property or copyright, or breaks their online policy,
        please let me know ASAP via Github Issues.</p>

        <p>As with any RPG, the character sheet is the heart of the
        game.</p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/character_tab_0.1.0.webp"
        /><h2>Character Tab</h2><ul><li><p>At the top, you have the character's
        name</p></li><li><p>Next to the name are the character's current total
        Attribute Points (AP) and Experience Points (XP). The AP value can be
        used along with pp45 of the rulebook to determine the cost of attribute
        increases. The XP field is always adjusted manually when XP are earned
        or spent.</p></li><li><p>Next are the different tabs or pages for the
        character sheet, I'll cover those later. Clicking on the title of each
        switches to that page.</p></li><li><p>Then there are a few fields for
        basic information such as the character type, race, age,
        etc.</p></li><li><p>The next block down shows the four main character
        attributes: Strength (ST), Dexterity (DX), Intelligence (IQ), and
        Movement Allowance (MA). The larger number is the maximum value for that
        attribute, while smaller number marked <em>Adj.</em> is the current
        adjusted value. The maximum value won't normally change unless the
        character raises it through XP spends. The adjusted value can change for
        a lot of reasons - fatigue, damage, spells, situation, item effects,
        etc.</p></li><li><p>The button with a dice icon to the right of each
        attribute triggers an Attribute Roll against that
        attribute.</p></li><li><p>The button next to the Adjusted Movement
        Allowance indicates the current movement mode (Walk/Run, Swim, Fly) and
        can be used to with between the three. MA can be changed independently
        for each mode.</p></li><li><p>To the right of the attributes is the
        character portrait. Click on this to change it.</p></li><li><p>The next
        section down is a series of status indicators and modifiers. In order,
        they are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Encumbrance</strong> - this shows the
        weight the character can carry at each encumbrance level, and the
        current encumbrance level calculated from the equipment the character is
        carrying. Note that only equipment marked as <em>Equipped</em> or
        <em>Carried</em> counts for encumbrance. Anything <em>Dropped</em>,
        <em>Stowed</em> (nearby, such as on a horse or cart), or <em>Stored</em>
        (some distance away, such as in a home) does not count towards
        encumbrance. Adjustments to attributes from encumbrance are made
        automatically.</p></li><li><p><strong>Health</strong> - this bar shows
        the character's state of health. Normally, it's blank. When the
        character becomes fatigued it shows here as an amber bar. When they take
        damage it shows as a red bar. Both can be shown at the same
        time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mana</strong> - this shows any Mana
        available to the character from objects they have equipped, such as
        their Staff.</p></li><li><p>Finally, there are a series of fields to
        record current <strong>Fatigue</strong> or <strong>Damage</strong>
        taken, Mana available, and a series of modifiers for ST, DX, IQ, MA, and
        Initiative. These can be adjusted manually at any
        time.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Lastly on this tab is the
        <strong>Actions</strong> area. Here, each block represents available
        actions, such as a ready weapon, equipped armor, cast spells, etc. Most
        of these will have buttons that can be used to trigger dice rolls such
        as attacks or damage.</p><ul><li><p>Weapons also show the required ST
        for a weapon and an icon that turns amber if the ST requirement is not
        met.</p></li><li><p>Armor shows the number of hits the armor will
        absorb.</p></li><li><p>Spells show a button used to maintain the spell
        (and spend the appropriate fatigue), or to cancel the
        spell.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Notes Tab</h2><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/character_notes_tab_0.1.0.webp"
        /><p>The <strong>Notes</strong> tab is just one big freeform text
        notebook. Hover the mouse cursor over the top right corner and click the
        <strong>Edit</strong> icon to edit the text.</p><h2>Talents Tab</h2><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/character_talents_tab_0.1.0.webp"
        /><p>The <strong>Talents</strong> tab shows a table of Talents the
        character has.</p><ul><li><p>The icon on the left is for aesthetics
        only. Showing icons in tables can be turned off from the Foundry VTT
        Settings menu for Fantasy Trip.</p></li><li><p>Each line shows the name
        of the Talent, the attribute a roll will be made against by default
        (this can be changed in the Dice Roller if necessary), the IQ level of
        the Talent, and the cost to acquire the Talent (in IQ
        points).</p></li><li><p>The last line of the table shows the total IQ
        cost of all Talents.</p></li><li><p>Note that the cost shown will change
        depending on whether the character is a Hero or Wizard. as shown above,
        because this character is a Wizard, each Talent costs
        double.</p></li><li><p>There is a small Roll button which can be used to
        trigger a Talent roll.</p></li><li><p>The last three icons are for
        managing the Talent details. In order, they are:</p><ul><li><p>Send the
        Talent description to the Chat Log.</p></li><li><p>Edit the
        Talent.</p></li><li><p>Delete the
        Talent.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Inventory Tab</h2><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/character_inventory_tab_0.1.0.webp"
        /><p>The <strong>Inventory</strong> Tab records any equipment the
        character owns, some details, and where each item is.</p><ul><li><p>As
        with the Talents tab, an icon and the name of the item(s) are shown
        first.</p></li><li><p>Then there is the total $ cost of the item(s), the
        total weight of the item(s), and a Quantity. Most of the time, the
        Quantity will be 1, and the cost &amp; weight shown will be for a single
        item. Where the Quantity is higher, the cost &amp; weight are calculated
        accordingly.</p></li><li><p>If an item is a <strong>Container</strong> -
        a Container is any item that has a Capacity of greater than 0 - then
        that Capacity will be shown. More about Containers
        below.</p></li><li><p>A single icon shows the item(s)
        <strong>Location</strong>. Clicking on the current icon cycles to the
        next location. The locations are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Dropped</strong>
        - somewhere on the ground nearby</p></li><li><p><strong>Carried</strong>
        - on the character's person but not readied (say, in a backpack or
        pouch)</p></li><li><p><strong>Stowed</strong> - somewhere safe nearby,
        say on a horse or cart</p></li><li><p><strong>Stored</strong> -
        somewhere far away, at home or at an inn, not immediately
        available</p></li><li><p><strong>Equipped</strong> - on the character's
        person and ready for use</p></li></ul></li><li><p>As mentioned before,
        only <strong>Carried</strong> or <strong>Equipped</strong> items count
        against the character's encumbrance.</p></li><li><p>Weapons and armor
        are only considered ready if <strong>Equipped</strong>. Any other
        location, and they will not show in the Actions section of the Character
        Tab.</p></li><li><p>As with Talents, the Chat, Edit, and Delete icons
        are on the far
        right.</p></li></ul><h3>Containers</h3><p><strong>Containers</strong>
        let players put one item inside another, exactly as you would put
        something in a chest, backpack, or belt pouch.</p><p>Any item can be a
        Container - it just has to have it's Capacity set to greater than 0.
        Yes, a sword, or ring, or pocket, can be a Container. It's up to you to
        explain how, but this implementation does not limit what can be a
        Container. The only limits are: the total weight of all the items cannot
        exceed the Capacity of the Container, and you can't put one Container
        inside another.</p><p>The advantage of using a Container for something
        is that everything in the Container is automatically in the same
        location as the Container. If a chest is stored at your rooms in the
        local tavern and you put something in the chest, it's in the tavern as
        well. The major reason for having Containers is to simplify combat - a
        character can put a bunch of items in a backpack and be heavily
        encumbered, but when they go into combat they only have to drop the
        backpack and not each item individually.</p><p>To move items into or out
        of Containers, simply hover over the name (a hand icon will show) then
        click and drag the item. Drop it on a Container to move it to that
        Container, drop it anywhere else on the sheet to move it out of a
        Container.</p><p>Items in a Container will show a small arrow to the
        left of the name and will always appear directly under their Container.
        Their location icon will also disappear.</p><h2>Spells Tab</h2><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/character_spells_tab_0.1.0.webp"
        /><p>The <strong>Spells</strong> tab shows any spells the character has
        learned.</p><ul><li><p>The usual icon and spell name come
        first.</p></li><li><p>Then we have the spell type (Missile, Thrown,
        Creation, Special).</p></li><li><p>Then there's the IQ level of the
        spell and the IQ cost to learn it. As with Talents, the cost shown is
        adjusted based on the character type.</p></li><li><p>Then the ST
        required to cast the spell is shown. This can either be a single value,
        or a range if the spell can be cast at different
        strengths.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Cast</strong> button triggers a
        spell casting roll.</p></li><li><p>And we finish with the usual Chat,
        Edit, and Delete icons.</p></li></ul><h2>Effects Tab</h2><p>Foundry VTT
        has a system called Active Effects that allows changes to be made to the
        character based simply on items they have in their possession. For
        example, a Wizard's Staff can add Mana, a Ring of Giant Strength might
        add to the character's ST, Boots of Running could increase the
        character's MA. All of these changes can happen automatically when a
        character has the item in their Inventory. In this system, the item
        <strong>must</strong> also be Equipped for the effect to be
        active.</p><p>More information on Active Effects can be found on the <a
        href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/active-effects/">Foundry VTT web
        site</a>.</p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/character_effects_tab_0.1.0.webp"
        /><p>The <strong>Effects</strong> tab shows any Active Effects attached
        to items in the character's possession. If the character has an item but
        it is not Equipped, the effect will not be listed. Each effect also
        shows the changes that it makes to the character. Note that effects
        derived from an item cannot be edited here, they must be edited on the
        item itself. See the Item Sheet instructions for more.</p><p>You can
        also create Active Effects directly on the character from here using the
        Create button. Effects created in this way can be edited,
        enabled/disabled, and deleted from this tab. These can be used to
        represent spells, curses, diseases, and so on. Any changes made via
        effects are completely independent of the manual modifiers on the
        Character Tab.</p>

        <p>In most Foundry games, an Item is basically anything that's not an
        Actor (Player Character, NPC, monster, etc). In the Fantasy Trip
        implementation for Foundry, there are three types of
        Item:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Talents</strong> are a direct translation of
        Talents from the rulebook.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spells</strong> are
        also a direct translation of Spells from the
        rulebook.</p></li><li><p><strong>Equipment</strong> is everything else,
        which can include weapons, armor, scrolls, books, bags &amp; packs,
        tools, potions… pretty much any physical object a character can
        carry.</p></li><li><p><strong>Abilities</strong> represent any other
        powers or innate capabilities. These might be supernatural powers (such
        as a Lich's damage absorption), natural weapons or defenses (such as
        those gained by a werewolf in their wolf form), or the ability to cast
        spells innately.</p></li></ul><p>Items are created and edited from the
        Item Sheet, which has three tabs:</p><ul><li><p>The
        <strong>Description</strong> tab has a free form text field for entering
        notes on the item, and a series of fields that set the parameters of the
        item. These fields will vary depending on the type of
        item.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Actions</strong> tab shows any actions
        that can be taken with the item, they
        are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Attacks</strong> - an action that requires an
        attack roll and does damage</p></li><li><p><strong>Defenses</strong> -
        any way in which the item stops incoming
        damage</p></li><li><p><strong>Spells</strong> - any spells written on or
        bound into the item that can be cast by the user when the item is
        readied.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The <strong>Effects</strong> tab shows
        any Active Effects that the item has. More about Active Effects can be
        found <a
        href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/active-effects/">here</a>.</p></li></ul><h2>Talents</h2><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/talent_description_tab_0.1.0.webp"
        /><p>Talents have only three descriptive fields:</p><ul><li><p>The IQ
        level needed to learn the Talent.</p></li><li><p>The IQ cost to acquire
        the Talent. Note that this is the base (book) cost for the Talent. When
        it is added to a character sheet, the cost paid will be calculated
        depending on whether the character is a Hero or
        Wizard.</p></li><li><p>The default attribute to use for Talent rolls.
        Note that this can be changed later in the Dice Roller depending on the
        circumstances.</p></li></ul><h2>Spells</h2><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/spell_description_tab_0.1.0.webp"
        /><p>Spells are slightly more complex than Talents, and have the
        following fields:</p><ul><li><p>The IQ level needed to learn the
        Spell.</p></li><li><p>The IQ cost to acquire the Spell. Note that this
        is the base (book) cost for the Spell. When it is added to a character
        sheet, the cost paid will be calculated depending on whether the
        character is a Hero or Wizard.</p></li><li><p>The Type of spell
        (Missile, Thrown, Creation, Special).</p></li><li><p>The minimum ST cost
        to cast the spell.</p></li><li><p>The maximum ST cost to cast the
        spell.</p></li><li><p>The ST cost required to maintain the
        spell.</p></li></ul><h2>Equipment</h2><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/equipment_description_tab_0.1.0.webp"
        /><p>Every item of equipment has the following fields:</p><ul><li><p>The
        unit cost in $ of the item.</p></li><li><p>The unit weight in lbs of the
        item.</p></li><li><p>The quantity of the item to hand.</p></li><li><p>A
        lbs Capacity if the item is to be a container.</p></li><li><p>A field
        which specifies when any Active Effects on the item will apply to the
        character.</p></li></ul><p>Note that when added to the character sheet,
        the unit cost &amp; weight of an item will be multiplied by the quantity
        to give a total cost &amp; weight carried.</p><h3>Containers</h3><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/equipment_container_tab_0.1.0.webp"
        /><p><strong>Containers</strong> are a special kind of equipment in that
        a Container is allowed to hold other items. The only difference between
        a normal piece of equipment and a Container is that a Container has a
        <strong>Capacity</strong> set to greater than 0 in lbs. A Container
        still has its own weight &amp; cost independent of anything within it
        (also quantity, but that is usually 1).</p><p>And yes, anything can be a
        container, it doesn't have to be a real life container like a backpack
        or belt pouch, and there is no limit to the capacity.</p><p>So, a simple
        small bag might be a magical bag that can actually "contain" several
        hundred lbs of equipment. An item you wouldn't normally think of as a
        container might also be one - a ring, locket, sword, knife, shield…
        anything can be a container.</p><p>On the character sheet inventory tab,
        simple drag other items into or out of the container. If the container
        hits it's capacity, you;ll see a warning and the item you're dragging
        will not be accepted.</p><h2>Actions</h2><p>Much like any piece of
        equipment, any Item can have <strong>Actions</strong> associated with it
        - Attacks, Defenses, and Spells.</p><p>Firstly, there are the obvious
        examples:</p><ul><li><p>A weapon (such as a sword) will have one or more
        Attacks.</p></li><li><p>A piece of armor or a shield will have one or
        more Defenses.</p></li><li><p>A scroll or spellbook will have one or
        more Spells.</p></li></ul><p>But there are also any number of
        combinations that can be used to represent gadgets or magic items, for
        example:</p><ul><li><p>A sword might have attacks <strong>and</strong>
        one or more spells bound to it.</p></li><li><p>A piece of armor might
        have its usual defenses, and also a few handy defensive spells bound to
        it.</p></li><li><p>A ring or glove might have spells bound to them, or
        even some attacks or defenses.</p></li><li><p>A Talent such as Martial
        Arts might have both attacks &amp; defenses.</p></li><li><p>A spell
        might have attack or defensive capabilities.</p></li></ul><p>Whatever
        the Actions are, in this implementation they only become available for
        use if the Item is <strong>readied</strong>, which
        means:</p><ul><li><p>A Talent is readied automatically and its actions
        are always available.</p></li><li><p>An Ability is readied if it is
        always on or if it is activated.</p></li><li><p>A piece of equipment is
        readied only when it's location is
        <strong>equipped</strong>.</p></li><li><p>A Spell is readied only after
        it has been successfully cast.</p></li></ul><h3>Attacks</h3><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/item_attacks_0.1.0.webp"
        /><p>Attacks include the following fields:</p><ul><li><p>The
        <strong>Attack Action</strong> is used purely descriptively, so names
        like Strike, Sweep, Blast, Thrust, etc. Note that a weapon can have
        several actions, each with it's own set of parameters. A staff, for
        example, might have Strike and Sweep attacks.</p></li><li><p>The
        <strong>Type</strong> is (Natural, Hand-to-Hand, Melee, Polearm, Thrown,
        Missile) indicates the nature of the attack. It also determines which
        attack modifier to be applied if the character has an Active Effect that
        gives them one.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>To-Hit Mod</strong> is a
        to-hit modifier specific to this weapon. This can be used to represent
        fine or magical weapons, such as a +1 sword.</p></li><li><p>The
        <strong>Base Damage</strong> is the damage the attack does under normal
        circumstances. This may be multiplied for critical
        hits.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Min ST to Use</strong> is the minimum
        ST the character needs to wield the weapon. If they don't meet this
        requirement, then attack penalties are automatically
        applied.</p></li></ul><p>It will probably be an item of equipment that
        has attacks, such as a sword, knife, staff, etc. But Spells and Talents
        can also have attacks.</p><p>If a Talent has attacks, they might be
        Martial Arts blows or natural weapons. If a spell has attacks, it might
        be something like Fireball, Magic Fist, or Lightning. Remember, Talents
        are always considered ready, so those attacks are always available. A
        spell only becomes ready, and it's attacks available, if it is
        successfully cast.</p><h3>Defenses</h3><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/item_defenses_o.1.0.webp"
        /><p>Each defense has just:</p><ul><li><p>A <strong>Defense
        Action</strong>, which is used purely descriptively, such as Block,
        Armor, etc.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Number of Hits Stopped</strong>
        if the defense applies when attacked.</p></li></ul><p>When an attack
        lands and damage has been rolled, the GM can apply that damage to a PC
        or NPC automatically if they are targeted in Foundry. The GM can choose,
        based on circumstances, which of a character's readied defenses can be
        used.</p><p>For example, if a character is carrying a shield and wearing
        armor, the armor will always stop damage, but the shield will only if
        the attack came from the shield side. The GM gets to choose based on
        their view of the situation.</p><h3>Spells</h3><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/item_spells_0.1.0.webp"
        /><p>Any item can contain spells. If a Talent has spells, the talent
        might represent some innate powers the character possesses, for example.
        But, more often than not, spells will be attached to a piece of
        equipment, which would most likely be a scroll, spell book, or magical
        artifact.</p><p>Spells attached to an item have only two
        fields:</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>Name</strong> of the spell. Note that
        the only spells that will appear in the selection list will be spells
        that exist in the game world - ie: they appear in one or more item lists
        (in the Foundry sidebar). Spells entered directly onto a character sheet
        or in compendia will not appear, they must be imported into an items
        list.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Burn Item When Cast</strong> field
        tells Foundry to delete the item with the spell if the spell is cast
        (whether successful or not). So, for spell books this setting is turned
        off (the book doesn't disappear when a spell is cast), and for scrolls
        or potions it would be turned on.</p></li></ul><p>There is no limit to
        the number of spells an item can have.</p><p><em>Note that due to the
        limitations of Foundry VTT, only spells that are known by the player or
        otherwise imported into the game world can be bound to an item. Spells
        in a compendium or known to other players will not be available for
        selection.</em></p><h2>Effects</h2><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/equipment_effects_tab_0.1.0.webp"
        /><p>The <strong>Effects</strong> tab details any Foundry Active Effects
        the item has that will be transferred to the character. This varies
        depending on the type of item:</p><ul><li><p>Effects on
        <strong>Talents</strong> will always be applied.</p></li><li><p>Effects
        on <strong>Abilities</strong> will be applied when the ability is
        activated, or if it is always on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spell</strong>
        effects are never applied (so far, spells are still "in
        development").</p></li><li><p><strong>Equipment</strong> effects are
        applied if the item is in a location specified in the
        settings.</p></li></ul><p>In the above example, the Wizard's Staff has a
        <strong>Mana</strong> effect set to apply only when the staff is
        equipped. When this item is <strong>readied</strong> (location set to
        <em>equipped</em>), then the effect <strong>will be applied to the
        character</strong>, boosting their available maximum available mana
        score. An item can have any number of effects, and they will all be
        applied to the character.</p><p>By varying the <em>Apply Effects
        When…</em> field, a variety of items can be created.</p><ul><li><p>A
        Ring of Giant Strength would only apply the increased STR effect when
        worn (equipped).</p></li><li><p>A backpack applies it's encumbrance (DX
        reduction) either when equipped or carried (ie: on the character's
        person).</p></li><li><p>A cursed item might apply an effect if the
        character simply owns it (any location).</p></li></ul><p>See the pages
        on @UUID[.ZC0ir9H0OUqr0Ehw]{Writing Effects} for details on which
        character attributes can be changed by an effect.</p><h1>How to Create
        Items</h1><p>The item system should be flexible enough to create almost
        anything you need in the game world. For guidance, here are some
        examples:</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Weapon</strong></p></td><td><p>An
        item of <strong>equipment</strong> with one or more
        <strong>attack</strong> actions. You can add more than one attack - a
        spear, for example, can be used as a melee weapon or a missile weapon.
        This would have a melee attack and a missile
        attack.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Armor</strong></p></td><td><p>An
        item of <strong>equipment</strong> with one or more
        <strong>defense</strong> actions (usually only
        one).</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Shield</strong></p></td><td><p>An
        item of <strong>equipment</strong> with one or more
        <strong>defense</strong> actions (usually only
        one).</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Backpack/Pouch,
        etc</strong></p></td><td><p>An item of <strong>equipment</strong> with a
        capacity greater than 0.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>A disease or
        condition</strong></p></td><td><p>An <strong>ability</strong> with
        <strong>effects</strong> that reduce attributes or apply negative
        modifiers to tasks, marked as <strong>always
        on</strong>.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>An intermittent condition,
        such as Lycanthropy</strong></p></td><td><p>An <strong>ability</strong>
        with <strong>effects</strong> that alter attributes (higher or lower).
        Activating the ability applies the
        effects.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>A wizard's
        spellbook</strong></p></td><td><p>An item of <strong>equipment</strong>
        with one or more <strong>spell</strong> actions. Each should be marked
        so that the item is NOT burned when the spell is
        cast.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>A magic
        scroll</strong></p></td><td><p>An item of <strong>equipment</strong>,
        usually with only a single <strong>spell</strong> action marked such
        that the item is burned when the spell is
        cast.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

        <p>Active Effects are a key feature of Foundry VTT. They allow temporary
        changes to be made to a character based on items in their possession or
        can be added directly to the character. They can have assigned durations
        in play time or combat turns &amp; rounds, so that they start and expire
        automatically.</p><p>Each effect can target one or more character
        attributes or stat values, and can modify it in various
        ways:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Add</strong> - Adds the provided value to a
        number. This can be used to both add and subtract from a particular
        value by specifying +1 or -1 as the value to
        add.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multiply</strong> - Multiplies the defined
        attribute by the numeric value in the Effect Value
        field.</p></li><li><p><strong>Override</strong> - Replaces the defined
        attribute with the value provided in the Effect Value
        field.</p></li><li><p><strong>Downgrade</strong> - Reduces the defined
        attribute only in cases where the current value of that attribute would
        be greater than value specified in the Effect Value
        field.</p></li><li><p><strong>Upgrade</strong> - Increases the defined
        attribute only in cases where the current value of that attribute would
        be less than value specified in the Effect Value
        field.</p></li><li><p><strong>Custom</strong> - The Custom change mode
        applies logic defined by a game system or add-on
        module.</p></li></ul><p>A single item (or character effect) can modify

        the reason why attributes are split into <em>max</em> and <em>value</em>
        pairs, with those specific names, is that Foundry VTT recognizes them as
        being attributes and can use them to display status bars on the
        character's map token if necessary.</p><p></p>

        <h2>Shortcut Buttons</h2><p>Within the Fantasy Trip system, all the
        usual dice rolling mechanisms of Foundry still work - rolls via the chat
        log, modules like Dice Tray, etc. The implementation adds short-uts for
        most of the rolls in the game system - attribute saves, talent checks,
        spell casting, attack &amp; damage rolls, etc.</p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/dice_rolls_1.webp"
        /><p>Wherever you see pale yellow button on the character (or NPC)
        sheet, that's a shortcut for a dice roll.</p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/dice_rolls_2.webp"
        /><p></p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/dice_rolls_3.webp"
        /><p>The button might have an icon, some text that describes the roll,
        or even more detailed text showing the relevant attribute &amp; target
        number.</p><h2>The Dice Roller</h2><p>Whenever you use a shortcut to
        trigger a dice roll, the Dice Roller app will open and be configured for
        that type of roll with its various values preset.</p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/dice_roller_attack.webp"
        /><p>It will show the type of roll, the relevant attribute rolled
        against and it's current value, a series of modifiers, the number of
        dice to be rolled, and the mode of the roll (see <a
        href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/dice/">Roll Modes</a>).</p><p>For
        any given roll, everything but the roll type can be changed.</p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/dice_roller_cast.webp"
        /><p>For spell casting rolls, if the amount of ST used to cast the spell
        can be varied, the Dice Roller will show buttons so that the required ST
        can be selected.</p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/dice_roller_damage.webp"
        /><p>For damage rolls, the fields allow you to enter or change the dice
        formula, select a minimum damage, a damage multiplier, and how increased
        damage is calculated.</p><p>If the damage roll is triggered using a chat
        log button as part of an attack sequence (see
        @UUID[Compendium.fantasy-trip.using-fantasy-trip-for-foundry-vtt.JournalEntry.KaQZyogQKvA3r2vi.JournalEntryPage.taYa6XujJcawZlXZ]{Combat}
        ) and a critical hit was landed, then these values will be preset
        accordingly.</p>

        <h2>Design Note</h2><p><em>Foundry has a pretty much set combat
        structure of initiative/round/turn that is difficult to change and often
        results in fragile (ie: easily breakable) code. With the following
        implementation, I've tried to adapt it to Fantasy Trip's "split
        initiative" structure as simply as possible to avoid problems. This  may
        change, but for now, here it is.</em></p><h2>Starting
        Combat</h2><p>Combat is initiated in the standard Foundry manner. Create
        a scene, create an encounter, add the combatants, roll starting
        initiative, and start the encounter.</p><h2>Initiative and
        Rounds</h2><p>Fantasy Trip features a "split initiative" flow, where 1D6
        is rolled for movement initiative, then all movement takes place, then
        combat takes place in order of adjusted DX (using the rolled initiative
        as a tie breaker).</p><p>In Foundry, this is implemented within the
        standard round/turn structure with even numbered rounds as movement
        rounds with a rolled initiative and odd numbered rounds as combat
        rounds. For example:</p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/combat_encounter_1.webp"
        /><p>Uldor has unexpectedly run into a lone Goblin. The GM creates an
        encounter and adds them both, then rolls initiative using the
        <strong>Roll All</strong> button at the top of the Combat Tracker.
        Initiative is rolled as 1D6 (with an additional 1D61D6 as decimals to
        act as a tie breaker). The <strong>Combat Tracker</strong> shows this is
        a <strong>Movement Round</strong>.</p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/combat_encounter_2.webp"
        /><p>When both combatants have taken their turn moving, Foundry moves on
        to the next round and recalculates initiative. In this case, the Combat
        Tracker shows this is a <strong>Combat Round</strong>. Initiative is now
        based on adjusted DX with the previous initiative added as decimals to
        act as a tie breaker.</p><p>The GM can step through each combatant turn
        and the following rounds with Foundry automatically re-rolling
        initiative as required.</p><h2>Attacks &amp; Damage</h2><p>To make an
        attack, a combatant MUST have an appropriate talent or equipped weapon.
        Buttons for attacks &amp; damage show as readied items at the bottom of
        the Character tab.</p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/dice_rolls_1.webp"
        /><p>Click on the button, and the Dice Roller will open with the
        required values preset. The various modifiers (situation, range, etc)
        can then be changed as needed. When the <strong>Roll</strong> button is
        clicked, a chat message will appear with the result of the roll.</p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/combat_chat_1.webp"
        /><p>This will show whether the attack succeeded or failed, and whether
        it was a critical success or failure.</p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/combat_chat_2.webp"
        /><p>You can check to see how the target number and roll were calculated
        by click either on the dice formula or result.</p><p>The GM and player
        owning the combatant will also see a <strong>Roll Damage</strong>
        button. Clicking this will reopen the dice roller, preset with the
        appropriate values.</p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/combat_chat_3.webp"
        /><p>When the damage is rolled, the result will show as another chat
        message, one for each target hit.</p><p>In this case, the GM (and only
        the GM) will see an <strong>Apply x Damage to Y button</strong> - if and
        only if a specific combatant was targeted. If no combatant was targeted,
        then the button will not show and the GM must apply damage
        manually.</p><p>Clicking the <strong>Apply Damage</strong> button brings
        up a small dialog showing any defenses the target has (armor, shields,
        spells, etc), and the GM can select or deselect any that apply to the
        blow (such as deselecting a shield for blows from behind).</p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/combat_apply_damage.webp"
        /><p>Once the <strong>Apply Damage</strong> button is clicked, the
        player who owns the the targeted token, and the GM, will see a final
        chat message. The appropriate damage is automatically added to the
        targeted character or NPC.</p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/combat_chat_4.webp"
        /><h2>Targeting</h2><p>Foundry has a mechanism for specifying which
        combatants are the target of an attack, appropriately called
        <strong>Targeting</strong> (see <a
        href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/tokens/">Token Controls</a>). You
        don't <strong>have</strong> to use targeting in combat, but it really
        speeds up and eases combat if you do.</p><p>When you have one or more
        tokens targeted for an attack…</p><ul><li><p>The names of those tokens
        appear in any chat log messages for the attack</p></li><li><p>The GM
        will see a separate chat log message for each target
        hit</p></li><li><p>The GM will have an Apply Damage button for each
        target in the chat log</p></li></ul><h2>Combat Settings</h2><p>To allow
        for different GM's wanting to run combat in different ways, the
        following settings can be changed using Foundry's Game Settings
        dialog:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Use Fantasy Trip Initiative</strong>: On
        by default, turning this off reverts back to Foundry's basic round/turn
        structure with 1D6.1D61D6 rolls for
        initiative.</p></li><li><p><strong>PC Group Initiative</strong>: Off by
        default, movement initiative is rolled separately for each PC. Turning
        this on makes only a single initiative roll that applies to every
        PC.</p></li><li><p><strong>NPC Group Initiative</strong>: On by default,
        movement initiative is rolled once and applies to every NPC. Turning
        this on makes a separate initiative roll for each
        NPC.</p></li></ul><h2>Initiative Bonuses</h2><p>Each character sheet has
        an <strong>Init Mod</strong> field that can be used as a temporary bonus
        to that character's individual initiative.</p><p>Active Affects can also
        be used to add to both individual initiative or party initiative, as for
        the <strong>Tactics</strong> and <strong>Strategy</strong> talents, for
        example (see
        @UUID[Compendium.fantasy-trip.using-fantasy-trip-for-foundry-vtt.JournalEntry.KaQZyogQKvA3r2vi.JournalEntryPage.ZC0ir9H0OUqr0Ehw]{Writing

        <p>Casting a spell using this implementation is easy. Spells appear on
        the Spells tab on the character sheet (or the Inventory tab on the NPC
        sheet), and each spell has a <strong>Cast</strong> button next to it.
        Click that button, and the Dice roller appears, preset for casting that
        spell.</p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/dice_roller_cast.webp"
        /><p>If the spell has a variable ST cost, that can be altered before the
        roll is made. Any situation or range modifiers can be selected as
        well.</p><h2>Spell Effects</h2><p>For the most part, spell effects need
        to be interpreted manually - since spells can have such a wide ranging
        set of effects. This may change in future, but for now it's the easiest
        way to cope with such a variety of spell effects. Two mechanisms have
        been implemented though:</p><h3>Attack Spells</h3><p>Spells which have
        an attack component, like Fireball or Lightning, will behave like weapon
        attacks. Hit messages, Roll Damage buttons, etc (see
        @UUID[Compendium.fantasy-trip.using-fantasy-trip-for-foundry-vtt.JournalEntry.KaQZyogQKvA3r2vi.JournalEntryPage.taYa6XujJcawZlXZ#attacks-and-damage]{Attacks
        &amp; Damage}).</p><h3>Maintained Spells</h3><p>Spells which have
        effects that last longer than a single round, that is they have a
        maintenance cost, will show as readied actions on the Character tab of
        the character sheet. They will show <strong>Maintain</strong> and
        <strong>Cancel</strong> buttons. When it comes time for the spell to be
        maintained, clicking the Maintain button will automatically add the
        fatigue cost, while cancel will remove the spell from the readied
        actions.</p>

        <h2>Importing</h2><p>Rather than create a character or NPC by hand, you
        can import them from other apps or sources. This
        includes:</p><ul><li><p>SJG Standard Text Format as detailed <a
        href="https://www.sjgames.com/general/guidelines/authors/writing-thefantasytrip/">here</a>.</p></li><li><p>Fantasy
        Trip Helper App for iOS &amp; Android (TBA)</p></li><li><p>Roll 20
        Fantasy Trip (TBA)</p></li></ul><p>To import a character, go to the
        dropdown menu at the top of the character sheet (three vertical dots at
        the top right) and select <strong>Import Actor</strong>. The import data
        can be pasted into the box provided, or loaded from a file. The file
        should be a plain text file in UTF-8 encoding - this is pretty standard
        for most text files these days.</p><p>When importing, character details
        such as their name, type (Hero/Wizard) and age will be imported along
        with their basic stats (ST, DX, IQ, MA). Everything else (Equipment,
        Armor, Weapons, Spells, Talents, etc) will be imported as items with the
        appropriate item type.</p><p><em>Note that when importing items, if an
        item with a matching name exists in the game world (ie: it has been
        created or imported into the world's item collection from a compendium)
        then a copy of that item will be added to the character. So, for
        example, if the text format includes <strong>Backpack</strong> as an
        item of equipment and a <strong>Backpack</strong> item exists in the
        world, then the item details will be pulled from the world collection
        and the imported item will have the correct cost, weight, effects, etc.
        For languages, this should be a Talent with the name <strong>Language
        (&lt;name&gt;)</strong>, eg: <strong>Language
        (Common)</strong>.</em></p><p>If an item is imported that does not
        exist, a new item is added to the character with only default details
        set.</p><p><em>Note also that cutting &amp; pasting text from an SJG or
        third-party publication <strong>should</strong> work, if the format is
        as described in the SJG document. Unfortunately, parsing free format
        text is not always guaranteed, so the text may need some editing to
        match the expected format. If something won't import, you can check the
        browser';s console log for error
        messages.</em></p><h2>Exporting</h2><p>If you have a character you'd
        like to use outside Foundry VTT, you can export that character to
        Standard Text Format.</p><p>Go to the dropdown menu at the top of the
        character sheet and select the export format. The character data will be
        downloaded and saved to a file with an appropriate name.</p>
