        <h2>History</h2><p>Like a lot of people, I started playing <strong>The
        Fantasy Trip</strong> back around 1979, first with
        <strong>Melee</strong> and <strong>Wizard</strong> and later with the
        full blown <strong>In The Labyrinth</strong>. I was also playing a fair
        bit of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Chivalry &amp; Sorcery, but I found
        Fantasy Trip intriguing in its simple complexity.</p><p>It didn't have
        D&amp;D's "Vancian Magic" (remember a spell, cast it, forget it), which
        I've disliked from day one, and it didn't have classes or levels. A
        character could be and do whatever you wanted without having to fit into
        predesignated slots.  C&amp;S was a similar in those respects, but was
        also an order of magnitude crunchier than D&amp;D - and was printed
        using text so small I can't even read the 1st edition book these
        days.</p><p>Fantasy Trip filled that gap where a game was simple enough
        to be easy to learn and play but complex enough to create a richness of
        detail in the settings &amp; adventures.</p><p>Although I hadn't played
        the game in over 30 years, I was pleasantly surprised when Steve Jackson
        Games resurrected it in 2019 with the <strong>Legacy Edition</strong>. I
        signed up for the full print/PDF package straight away, and was not
        disappointed with the end product. It brought back a lot of
        memories.</p><p>But, time and circumstances came along and I still
        didn't play the game. Then, finally in 2024, I retired and started
        picking up older games, including Fantasy Trip. I couldn't find a local
        gaming group for it, and although there was online support in
        <strong>Roll 20</strong> and <strong>Owlbear Rodeo</strong> could be
        used generically, there wasn't a <strong>Foundry VTT</strong>
        implementation, and Foundry is my go-to VTT these days.</p><p>Luckily,
        I've spent the last 30 years as a software developer, and have even
        implemented a few modules &amp; systems for friends. So, I set about
        implementing it for Foundry, and here's the
        result.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><h2>Design Notes</h2><p>The design philosophy
        for all of the systems I've written for Foundry is not necessarily to
        implement each game rule or process in detail, but rather to implement
        key features in a way that takes the repetitive or complex tasks off of
        the players &amp; GM and makes it easier for them to do the rest. I've
        found this gives the users a lot of freedom in how the rules are
        interpreted and applied without constraining them too much.</p><p>For
        example, I did consider having strict AP limits and XP spending for
        advancement, but determined that would have been complicated to
        implement &amp; use, so opted for a simple AP total on the character
        sheet that highlights in red if a set limit is exceeded without spending
        XP. This gives players an indication of their AP total that they can use
        to determine the cost as per pp45 of the rulebook. It's up to the GM to
        enforce those costs or not, according to how they want the game played.
        XP spends for other items just use the XP total field, manually
        adjusted.</p><p>The same goes for the Dice Roller application. It allows
        players to quickly see what a dice roll is made up from (target
        attribute(s), modifiers, number of dice, etc) and adjust the parameters
        before making the roll. Buttons are provided on the character sheet that
        act as "presets" for attribute rolls, talent rolls, attacks &amp;
        damage, spell casting, etc.</p><p>Encumbrance calculation though, is a
        chore, so I've automated that. A player can have as many items in their
        inventory as they like, they can choose each item's location (dropped,
        equipped, carried, stowed, stored) and the character's total encumbrance
        (based on carried or equipped items) is calculated automatically. That
        encumbrance level is shown on the character sheet and attribute
        penalties are applied automatically. I even added a "container" feature
        so that a character can put items in a backpack which counts them
        against encumbrance when carried, but if the backpack is dropped (say,
        for combat) then all the items in it are also dropped and the combat
        penalties come off immediately.</p><p>Hopefully, this design philosophy
        achieves what I set out to do: make it easy for old and new players to
        play the game the way they want in the way they're used to.</p><p>I'm
        always open to suggestions (and, of course, hearing about bugs), so
        please feel free to use  Github Issues to let me know what you like or
        dislike, what I got wrong, and what you want. Bear in mind though, I'm
        in this for fun, not money, and sometimes life happens and I can't make
        changes quickly.</p><h2>Steve Jackson Online Policy</h2><p>I have tried
        to ensure that this implementation conforms to the <a
        href="https://www.sjgames.com/general/online_policy.html">Steve Jackson
        Online Policy</a>, and since SJG rarely recognize or allow "official"
        versions of their games, this is an unofficial version.  This means that
        while I can implement the mechanisms of the game and even use some of
        the terminology, I cannot cut &amp; paste any significant content from
        the game and distribute it. This is why I've included only a few
        <em>Example Items</em> to show how Talents, Spells, and equipment can be
        built, and none of those items include descriptive text from the
        game.</p><p>If there is content in here that infringes on SJG
        intellectual property or copyright, or breaks their online policy,
        please let me know ASAP via Github Issues.</p>

        <p>As with any RPG, the character sheet is the heart of the
        game.</p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/character_tab_0.1.0.webp"
        /><h2>Character Tab</h2><ul><li><p>At the top, you have the character's
        name</p></li><li><p>Next to the name are the character's current total
        Attribute Points (AP) and Experience Points (XP). The AP value can be
        used along with pp45 of the rulebook to determine the cost of attribute
        increases. The XP field is always adjusted manually when XP are earned
        or spent.</p></li><li><p>Next are the different tabs or pages for the
        character sheet, I'll cover those later. Clicking on the title of each
        switches to that page.</p></li><li><p>Then there are a few fields for
        basic information such as the character type, race, age,
        etc.</p></li><li><p>The next block down shows the four main character
        attributes: Strength (ST), Dexterity (DX), Intelligence (IQ), and
        Movement Allowance (MA). The larger number is the maximum value for that
        attribute, while smaller number marked <em>Adj.</em> is the current
        adjusted value. The maximum value won't normally change unless the
        character raises it through XP spends. The adjusted value can change for
        a lot of reasons - fatigue, damage, spells, situation, item effects,
        etc.</p></li><li><p>The button with a dice icon to the right of each
        attribute triggers an Attribute Roll against that
        attribute.</p></li><li><p>The button next to the Adjusted Movement
        Allowance indicates the current movement m ode (Walk/Run, Swim, Fly) and
        can be used to with between the three. MA can be changed independently
        for each mode.</p></li><li><p>To the right of the attributes is the
        character portrait. Click on this to change it.</p></li><li><p>The next
        section down is a series of status indicators and modifiers. In order,
        they are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Encumbrance</strong> - this shows the
        weight the character can carry at each encumbrance level, and the
        current encumbrance level calculated from the equipment the character is
        carrying. Note that only equipment marked as <em>Equipped</em> or
        <em>Carried</em> counts for encumbrance. Anything <em>Dropped</em>,
        <em>Stowed</em> (nearby, such as on a horse or cart), or <em>Stored</em>
        (some distance away, such as in a home) does not count towards
        encumbrance. Adjustments to attributes from encumbrance are made
        automatically. On the sheet above, you can see the character is heavily
        encumbered and their DX and MA hav been adjusted
        accordingly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Health</strong> - this bar shows the
        character's state of health. Normally, it's blank. When the character
        becomes fatigued it shows here as an amber bar. When they take damage it
        shows as a red bar. Both can be shown at the same time. On the sheet
        above, the character has taken damage and is fatigued, so their ST has
        been adjusted automatically.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mana</strong> - for
        Player Characters, this bar will show only if they're a Wizard. It shows
        any Mana available to them from objects they have equipped, such as
        their Staff.</p></li><li><p>Finally, there are a series of fields to
        record current <strong>Fatigue</strong> or <strong>Damage</strong>
        taken, Mana available, and a series of modifiers for ST, DX, IQ, MA, and
        Initiative. These can be adjusted manually at any
        time.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Lastly on this tab is the
        <strong>Actions</strong> area. Here, each line represents an available
        action, such as a ready weapon, equipped armor, cast spells, etc. Most
        of these will have buttons that can be used to trigger dice rolls such
        as attacks or damage.</p><ul><li><p>Weapons also show the required ST
        for a weapon and an icon that turns amber if the ST requirement is not
        met.</p></li><li><p>Armor shows the number of hits the armor will
        absorb.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Notes Tab</h2><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/notes_tab_0.1.0.webp"
        /><p>The <strong>Notes</strong> tab is just one big freeform text
        notebook. Hover the mouse cursor over the top right corner and click the
        <strong>Edit</strong> icon to edit the text.</p><h2>Talents Tab</h2><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/talents_tab_0.1.0.webp"
        /><p>The <strong>Talents</strong> tab shows a table of Talents the
        character has.</p><ul><li><p>The icon on the left is for aesthetics
        only. Showing icons in tables can be turned off from the Foundry VTT
        Settings menu for Fantasy Trip.</p></li><li><p>Each line shows the name
        of the Talent, the attribute a roll will be made against by default
        (this can be changed in the Dice Roller if necessary), the IQ level of
        the Talent, and the cost to acquire the Talent (in IQ
        points).</p></li><li><p>The last line of the table shows the total IQ
        cost of all Talents.</p></li><li><p>Note that the cost shown will change
        depending on whether the character is a Hero or Wizard. as shown above,
        because this character is a Wizard, each Talent costs 2 IQ and not
        1.</p></li><li><p>There is a small Roll button which can be used to
        trigger a Talent roll.</p></li><li><p>The last three icons are for
        managing the Talent details. In order, they are:</p><ul><li><p>Send the
        Talent description to the Chat Log.</p></li><li><p>Edit the
        Talent.</p></li><li><p>Delete the
        Talent.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Inventory Tab</h2><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/inventory_tab_0.1.0.webp"
        /><p>The <strong>Inventory</strong> Tab records any equipment the
        character owns, some details, and where each item is.</p><ul><li><p>As
        with the Talents tab, an icon and the name of the item(s) are shown
        first.</p></li><li><p>Then there is the total $ cost of the item(s), the
        total weight of the item(s), and a Quantity. Most of the time, the
        Quantity will be 1, and the cost &amp; weight shown will be for a single
        item. Where the Quantity is higher, the cost &amp; weight are calculated
        accordingly.</p></li><li><p>If an item is a <strong>Container</strong> -
        a Container is any item that has a Capacity of greater than 0 - then.
        that Capacity will be shown. More about Containers
        below.</p></li><li><p>A single icon shows the item(s)
        <strong>Location</strong>. Clicking on the current icon cycles to the
        next location. The locations are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Dropped</strong>
        - somewhere on the ground nearby</p></li><li><p><strong>Carried</strong>
        - on the character's person but not readied (say, in a backpack or
        pouch)</p></li><li><p><strong>Stowed</strong> - somewhere safe nearby,
        say on a horse or cart</p></li><li><p><strong>Stored</strong> -
        somewhere far away, at home or at an inn, not immediately
        available</p></li><li><p><strong>Equipped</strong> - on the character's
        person and ready for use</p></li></ul></li><li><p>As mentioned before,
        only <strong>Carried</strong> or <strong>Equipped</strong> items count
        against the character's encumbrance.</p></li><li><p>Weapons and armor
        are only considered ready if <strong>Equipped</strong>. Any other
        location, and they will not show in the Actions section of the Character
        Tab.</p></li><li><p>As with Talents, the Chat, Edit, and Delete icons
        are on the far
        right.</p></li></ul><h3>Containers</h3><p><strong>Containers</strong>
        let players put one item inside another, exactly as you would put
        something in a chest, backpack, or belt pouch.</p><p>Any item can be a
        Container - it just has to have it's Capacity set to greater than 0.
        Yes, a sword, or ring, or pocket, can be a Container. It's up to you to
        explain how, but this implementation does not limit what can be a
        Container. The only limits are: the total weight of all the items cannot
        exceed the Capacity of the Container, and you can't put one Container
        inside another.</p><p>The advantage of using a Container for something
        is that everything in the Container is automatically in the same
        location as the Container. If a chest is stored at your rooms in the
        local tavern and you put something in the chest, it's in the tavern as
        well. The major reason for having Containers is to simplify combat - a
        character can put a bunch of items in a backpack and be heavily
        encumbered, but when they go into combat they only have to drop the
        backpack and not each item individually.</p><p>To move items into or out
        of Containers, simply hover over the name (a hand icon will show) then
        click and drag the item. Drop it on a Container to move it to that
        Container, drop it anywhere else on the sheet to move it out of a
        Container.</p><p>Items in a Container will show a small arrow to the
        left of the name and will always appear directly under their Container.
        Their location icon will also disappear.</p><h2>Spells Tab</h2><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/spells_tab_0.1.0.webp"
        /><p>The <strong>Spells</strong> tab shows any spells the character has
        learned.</p><ul><li><p>The usual icon and spell name come
        first.</p></li><li><p>Then we have the spell type (Missile, Thrown,
        Creation, Special).</p></li><li><p>Then there's the IQ level of the
        spell and the IQ cost to learn it. As with Talents, the cost shown is
        adjusted based on the character type.</p></li><li><p>Then the ST
        required to cast the spell is shown. This can either be a single value,
        or a range if the spell can be cast at different
        strengths.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Cast</strong> button triggers a
        spell casting roll.</p></li><li><p>And we finish with the usual Chat,
        Edit, and Delete icons.</p></li></ul><h2>Effects Tab</h2><p>Foundry VTT
        has a system called Active Effects that allows changes to be made to the
        character based simply on items they have in their possession. For
        example, a Wizard's Staff can add Mana, a Ring of Giant Strength might
        add to the character's ST, Boots of Running could increase the
        character's MA. All of these changes can happen automatically when a
        character has the item in their Inventory. In this system, the item
        <strong>must</strong> also be Equipped for the effect to be
        active.</p><p>More information on Active Effects can be found on the <a
        href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/active-effects/">Foundry VTT web
        site</a>.</p><img
        src="systems/fantasy-trip/assets/images/instructions/effects_tab_0.1.0.webp"
        /><p>The <strong>Effects</strong> tab shows any Active Effects attached
        to items in the character's possession. If the character has an item but
        it is not Equipped, the effect will not be listed. Each effect also
        shows the changes that it makes to the character. Note that effects
        derived from an item cannot be edited here, they must be edited on the
        item itself. See the Item Sheet instructions for more.</p><p>You can
        also create Active Effects directly on the character from here using the
        Create button. Effects created in this way can be edited,
        enabled/disabled, and deleted from this tab. These can be used to
        represent spells, curses, diseases, and so on. Any changes made via
        effects are completely independent of the manual modifiers on the
        Character Tab.</p>

        <p>Active Effects are a key feature of Foundry VTT. They allow temporary
        changes to be made to a character based on items in their possession or
        can be added directly to the character. They can have assigned durations
        in play time or combat turns &amp; rounds, so that they start and expire
        automatically.</p><p>Each effect can target one or more character
        attributes or stat values, and can modify it in various
        ways:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Add</strong> - Adds the provided value to a
        number. This can be used to both add and subtract from a particular
        value by specifying +1 or -1 as the value to
        add.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multiply</strong> - Multiplies the defined
        attribute by the numeric value in the Effect Value
        field.</p></li><li><p><strong>Override</strong> - Replaces the defined
        attribute with the value provided in the Effect Value
        field.</p></li><li><p><strong>Downgrade</strong> - Reduces the defined
        attribute only in cases where the current value of that attribute would
        be greater than value specified in the Effect Value
        field.</p></li><li><p><strong>Upgrade</strong> - Increases the defined
        attribute only in cases where the current value of that attribute would
        be less than value specified in the Effect Value
        field.</p></li><li><p><strong>Custom</strong> - The Custom change mode
        applies logic defined by a game system or add-on
        module.</p></li></ul><p>A single item (or character effect) can modify
        any or all of the following

        the reason why attributes are split into <em>max</em> and <em>value</em>
        pairs, with those specific names, is that Foundry VTT recognizes them as
        being attributes and can use them to display status bars on the
        character's map token if necessary.</p><p></p>
